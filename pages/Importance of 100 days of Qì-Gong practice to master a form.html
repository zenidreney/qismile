	It is a common saying in Qì-Gong circles that you need at least 100
	days of Qì-Gong practice to learn a form, and 1000 days to learn it
	better. In this article I would like to talk about the meaning of
	this ancient rule.</p>

	The simple movement of Qì-Gong and the specific sequence of the
	Qì-Gong forms serve to change the body structure of the
	practitioner. The most famous example of this is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yijin_Jing">

				Jin Jing</u></font>
	</a>, created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhidharma">
		<font color="#1155cc"><u>Da
				Mo</u></font>
	</a> around 550 A.D. a cornerstone in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaolin_Kung_Fu">

	practice. Yi Jin Jing literally means “Muscle Tendon Changing
	Classic”. As the name implies this sequence of Qì-Gong practice
	changes the muscles and tendons of the practitioner. As a matter of
	fact any Qì-Gong sequence will have similar effect, some more on the
	physical and other more on the emotional body. The important point
	here is to understand that the practice of any sequence on a daily
	basis will change the structure of the body. That is why it is said
	that you need a minimum of 100 days (circa 3 and a half months) of
	daily practice to start feeling a remarkable change in your body. Of
	course the change can be tangible after a few weeks. However if we
	persevere in our practice for 100 days we will be sure to have
	solidified the beneficial effect of the specific Qì-Gong practice in
	our bodies. After 100 days we can go on practicing the form but this
	time we can afford to have intermittent practice. We can even take a
	long pause while we learn another Qì-Gong form. This is akin to
	learning to play chords on a guitar. At first you will need to spend
	a lot of time to understand the position of your hands and how to use
	your muscles and tendons but once you have learned the basics the
	talent will be solidified for a lifetime.</p>

	There are hundreds of Qì-Gong forms available for practice. With the
	digital age we have access to a great variety of them with the touch
	of a finger. It is fun to try on different styles every practice
	session. Even this kind of practice will have a beneficial effect,
	for the mere fact that we are taking time for ourselves to practice
	Qì. However if we want to feel the real profound effect of a Qì-Gong
	sequence on our bodies it is advisable that we persevere in daily
	practice for a long time. 100 days or 3 and a half months of practice
	is good advice given to us by the ancient practitioners. We can stick
	to this advice remembering that 100 days is an analogy in order to
	say a long period of time. We should listen to our body and decide
	how much practice is enough for the change we want to achieve.</p>

	The bottom line is that I encourage you to stick with 1 or maximum of
	2 Qì-Gong forms for an extended period in order to see its deeper
	effect on your body and mind.</p>
