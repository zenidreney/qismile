                    <p class="lead text-start">
                        It is a common saying in Qì-Gong circles that you need at least 100
                        days of Qì-Gong practice to learn a form, and 1000 days to learn it
                        better. In this article I would like to talk about the meaning of
                        this ancient rule.
                    </p>

                    <p class="lead text-start">
                        The simple movement of Qì-Gong and the specific sequence of the
                        Qì-Gong forms serve to change the body structure of the
                        practitioner. The most famous example of this is <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yijin_Jing">
                            <font color="#1155cc"><u>Yi
                                    Jin Jing</u></font>
                        </a>, created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhidharma">
                            <font color="#1155cc"><u>Da
                                    Mo</u></font>
                        </a> around 550 A.D. a cornerstone in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaolin_Kung_Fu">
                            <font color="#1155cc"><u>Shaolin</u></font>
                        </a>
                        practice. Yi Jin Jing literally means “Muscle Tendon Changing
                        Classic”. As the name implies this sequence of Qì-Gong practice
                        changes the muscles and tendons of the practitioner. As a matter of
                        fact any Qì-Gong sequence will have similar effect, some more on the
                        physical and other more on the emotional body. The important point
                        here is to understand that the practice of any sequence on a daily
                        basis will change the structure of the body. That is why it is said
                        that you need a minimum of 100 days (circa 3 and a half months) of
                        daily practice to start feeling a remarkable change in your body. Of
                        course the change can be tangible after a few weeks. However if we
                        persevere in our practice for 100 days we will be sure to have
                        solidified the beneficial effect of the specific Qì-Gong practice in
                        our bodies. After 100 days we can go on practicing the form but this
                        time we can afford to have intermittent practice. We can even take a
                        long pause while we learn another Qì-Gong form. This is akin to
                        learning to play chords on a guitar. At first you will need to spend
                        a lot of time to understand the position of your hands and how to use
                        your muscles and tendons but once you have learned the basics the
                        talent will be solidified for a lifetime.
                    </p>

                    <p class="lead text-start">
                        There are hundreds of Qì-Gong forms available for practice. With the
                        digital age we have access to a great variety of them with the touch
                        of a finger. It is fun to try on different styles every practice
                        session. Even this kind of practice will have a beneficial effect,
                        for the mere fact that we are taking time for ourselves to practice
                        Qì. However if we want to feel the real profound effect of a Qì-Gong
                        sequence on our bodies it is advisable that we persevere in daily
                        practice for a long time. 100 days or 3 and a half months of practice
                        is good advice given to us by the ancient practitioners. We can stick
                        to this advice remembering that 100 days is an analogy in order to
                        say a long period of time. We should listen to our body and decide
                        how much practice is enough for the change we want to achieve.

                    <p class="lead text-start">
                        The bottom line is that I encourage you to stick with 1 or maximum of
                        2 Qì-Gong forms for an extended period in order to see its deeper
                        effect on your body and mind.
