                            <p class="lead text-start">
                                When we start out with Qì-Gong practice we may be overwhelmed by the vast number of styles
                                we come across. Legend goes that there are around 5000 different styles of qì-gong! This is
                                somehow understandable when we consider that qì-gong is a generic term referring to any
                                perseverent practice that helps to move qì (vital energy).
                            </p>
            
                            <p class="text-start">
                                Traditionally qì-gong styles are divided into four (I will present them in parentheses). In
                                my opinion this classification also follows the path of a qì-gong practitioner going from
                                beginner to more advanced. That is why I am using my own terms for each style.

                                Of course each stage is intermingled with one another. While you are healing you will also
                                be empowered, while you are calming you are also healing etc. Nevertheless these stages mark
                                the main intention of the practitioner. This classification also follows the path of
                                external to inner practice (Wai-Gong to Nei-Gong). We will talk more about these terms in a
                                later article.

                                For example, I once had a student that came to me with severe neck problems. He had to turn

                                normally use in our warm-up routine. He was persevering enough to practice everyday. After a
                                few months he not only could move his neck with ease but also he had also overcame his
                                hunched back and had an open chest. As a matter of fact simple qì-gong warm-up exercises can
                                serve as healing qì-gong.

                                The most famous qì-gong that many martial art practitioners are familiar with is Zhan Zhuang
                                (standing like a tree). In this practice you will be standing in a particular position for
                                prolonged periods and in a meditative state. This form of qì-gong will clear the qì
                                blockages in the meridians and strengthen the whole body structure. It is even said that by
                                perseverent practice this qì-gong will open the small heavenly circuit (microcosmic orbit)
                                without further effort by the practitioner.

                                Some other martial qì-gong sets will require a good amount of concentration in order to
                                guide and concentrate qi, increase flexibility and enhance the fluidity of qì. One famous
                                martial style that emphasizes these characteristics is Wu-Dang style qì-gong.

                                feather. What differentiates Tàijí quán from other martial arts systems is its softness of
                                movement that look like qì-gong movements. Learning Tàijí quán the correct way naturally
                                leads to forementioned qì skills in the practitioner. As a matter of fact Tàijí quán can be
                                considered of a combination of healing, empowerment and calming qì-gong.

                                health. Many calming qì-gong techniques will teach you to energise your “Ni-Wuan” (upper

                                At this point qì-gong will have already enhanced the senses of the practitioner. Now the

                                veil of existence and reach buddhahood. Using all the qì skills he/she has practiced, the
                                practitioner can now empower his/her DanTien with qì and channel it with his/her mind
                                through the center of his/her body (using the chong mai meridian) and awaken his/her soul at
                                the center of his/her limbic system (Upper DanTien). Thereupon he/she will be able to
                                energize the Upper DanTien and eventually open the Third Eye. All these practices will
                                empower the practitioners’ spirit and create a spiritual embryo that will be able to exist
