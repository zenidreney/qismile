                        <p class="lead text-start">
                            When we start out with Qì-Gong practice we may be overwhelmed by the vast number of styles
                            we come across. Legend goes that there are around 5000 different styles of qì-gong! This is
                            somehow understandable when we consider that qì-gong is a generic term referring to any
                            perseverent practice that helps to move qì (vital energy).
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-start">
                            Traditionally qì-gong styles are divided into four (I will present them in parentheses). In
                            my opinion this classification also follows the path of a qì-gong practitioner going from
                            beginner to more advanced. That is why I am using my own terms for each style.
                        </p>

                            Of course each stage is intermingled with one another. While you are healing you will also
                            be empowered, while you are calming you are also healing etc. Nevertheless these stages mark
                            the main intention of the practitioner. This classification also follows the path of
                            external to inner practice (Wai-Gong to Nei-Gong). We will talk more about these terms in a
                            later article.

                        <p class="lead text-start">Focus is on healing certain ailments and preventing disease.</p>

                        <p class="text-start">
                            In the first stage you are attracted to qì-gong in order to heal a certain ailment you
                            experience in your physical or emotional body.

                        <p class="text-start">
                            For example, I once had a student that came to me with severe neck problems. He had to turn
                            his torso in order to turn his neck. I have taught him turtle breathing technique, which we
                            normally use in our warm-up routine. He was persevering enough to practice everyday. After a
                            few months he not only could move his neck with ease but also he had also overcame his
                            hunched back and had an open chest. As a matter of fact simple qì-gong warm-up exercises can
                            serve as healing qì-gong.
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-start">
                            Ba-Duan-Jin is one of the most famous medical qì-gong sets. Another famous medical qì-gong
                            set is Taiji Qì-Gong (Shibashi). This set was created by Prof. Lin Hou Sheng in 1978, taking
                            18 Tai-Chi Chuan inspired movements with focus on health benefits.

                            This kind of qì-gong will boost your immune system so that we are more strong and you can

                            Now that you have healed your physical body and you have fallen in love with qì-gong

                            sensitivity to qì and accumulate it better in lower Dan-Tien.

                        <p class="text-start">
                            The most famous qì-gong that many martial art practitioners are familiar with is Zhan Zhuang
                            (standing like a tree). In this practice you will be standing in a particular position for
                            prolonged periods and in a meditative state. This form of qì-gong will clear the qì
                            blockages in the meridians and strengthen the whole body structure. It is even said that by
                            perseverent practice this qì-gong will open the small heavenly circuit (microcosmic orbit)
                            without further effort by the practitioner.
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-start">
                            Some other martial qì-gong sets will require a good amount of concentration in order to
                            guide and concentrate qi, increase flexibility and enhance the fluidity of qì. One famous
                            martial style that emphasizes these characteristics is Wu-Dang style qì-gong.

                            On the other hand there is Tàijí quán, where the practitioner will feel as soft as a
                            feather. What differentiates Tàijí quán from other martial arts systems is its softness of
                            movement that look like qì-gong movements. Learning Tàijí quán the correct way naturally
                            leads to forementioned qì skills in the practitioner. As a matter of fact Tàijí quán can be
                            considered of a combination of healing, empowerment and calming qì-gong.

                            In order to do that you will have to calm down your heart mind (Hsin) with meditative
                            qì-gong in stillness. Then you will also be able to relax your internal organs and feel the
                            flow of qì within.

                            This kind of practice will require you to practice inner qì-gong (nei-gong) techniques so
                            that you get familiar with your inner qì landscape. Calming the mind and heart will
                            eventually result in maintaining the optimal functioning of your inner organs and hence your
                            health. Many calming qì-gong techniques will teach you to energise your “Ni-Wuan” (upper
                            dantian, the limbic system) so that you can better regulate your moods. This will eventually
                            result in more efficient neurotransmitter and hormone secretion from the limbic system. The
                            result will be a happier attitude in life and higher emotional intelligence.

                            Buddhists, Tibetans and Taoist all seeking enlightenment but the latter also seeking
                            longevity.

                        <p class="text-start">
                            Once the practitioner is advanced enough with inner qì-gong techniques then he/she is ready
                            to take the practice one step further seeking for deeper meanings of life and existence.

                            At this point qì-gong will have already enhanced the senses of the practitioner. Now the

                            veil of existence and reach buddhahood. Using all the qì skills he/she has practiced, the
                            practitioner can now empower his/her DanTien with qì and channel it with his/her mind
                            through the center of his/her body (using the chong mai meridian) and awaken his/her soul at
                            the center of his/her limbic system (Upper DanTien). Thereupon he/she will be able to
                            energize the Upper DanTien and eventually open the Third Eye. All these practices will
                            empower the practitioners’ spirit and create a spiritual embryo that will be able to exist
                            in higher spiritual dimensions.

                            Of course this is a very simplistic way of putting it. Damo Mitchell has a great book on the

                            This kind of qì-gong should be learnt from a Daoist Master. Since it needs absolute
